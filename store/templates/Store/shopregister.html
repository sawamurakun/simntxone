        5.	Fees and Taxes
        The fees we charge for using our services are listed on our Fees for services excerpt.

        13.	Legal Disputes
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND SIMNTX HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
        
        You and SIMNTX agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and SIMNTX (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of SIMNTX) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or purchased through the services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this legal Disputes Section.
          
        A.	Applicable law
        You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the state of Michigan, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and SIMNTX, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.
        
        B.	Agreement to Arbitrate
        You and SIMNTX each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and SIMNTX (include any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of SIMNTX) that relate in any way to arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the services of SIMNTX or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
        
        1.	Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
        
        YOU AND SIMNTX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SIMNTX AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OF JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and SIMNTX’X right to appeal the court’s decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.
        
        2.	Arbitration Procedures
        
        Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the user agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to arbitrate, or the interpretation of section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“ Prohibition of class and Representative actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
        
        The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an Arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.
        
        A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send notice to the other, by certified mail. The notice shall describe the claim/dispute. The notice should be sent to SIMNTX, LLC. SIMNTX will send any notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.
        
        If you and SIMNTX are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or SIMNTX may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. Any settlement offer made by you or SIMNTX shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
        
        The arbitrator hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or SIMNTX may elect to have the arbitration conducted b telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and SIMNTX subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and / or SIMNTX may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
        
        The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SIMNTX user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered b the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        
        3.	Cost of Arbitration
        Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’S rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate.
        
        4.	Severability
        With the exception of any of the provisions in section 1 of this agreement to Arbitrate (“prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individual relief”), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply.
        
        14.	General
        Except as otherwise provided in this User Agreement, if any provision of this User agreement is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. In our sole discretion, we may assign this user agreement, and in such event, we will post notice on our website headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect t subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will act against all breaches of this user agreement.
        
        We may amend this user agreement at any time by posting the amended terms our website. Our right to amend the user Agreement includes the right to modify, add to, or remove terms in the user agreement. Your continued access or use of our services constitutes your acceptance of the amended terms. We may also ask you to acknowledge your acceptance of the user agreement through an electronic click-through. This user agreement may not otherwise be amended except through mutual agreement by you and a SIMNTX representative who intends to amend this user agreement and is duly authorized to agree to such an amendment.
